# ASU Registration BOT (Script is Coming soon)

## A python script that uses Selenium to automate registration process for Arizona State University Students

This project is built to automate the registration process for Arizona State University Students by using a Python script.
The script uses Selenium library to achive the following:

* Ask for the ASURITE username and password
* Give the user a choice between using a CSV file, or input the classes by hand
* Automatically add and enroll in classes that are specified
* Give the user a choice to automatically try to enroll in classes over specified period of time if classes are in closed status
* Give the user a choice to only enroll in classes that are in their cart
* Run infinitly until forced to exit, or until a specific amount of trials are excceded


## A Demo Will be provided

## Installation and Usage

For installation, right now the only way to use the program is by:
* Cloning the script 
* Instaling Selenium WebDriver by using:  pip install webdriver-manager
* Setting up the CSV file to include classes (more on that later)
* Running the script 
* Then using Duo 2-factor authentication to login
After logging in, the script should run without user interference
